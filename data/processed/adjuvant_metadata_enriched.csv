36,VO:0000127,VO_0000127,Aluminum Hydroxide,"Currently, a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) against serotypes A-E is used to immunize specific populations of at-risk individuals. The manufacture of PBT, by the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH), took place in stages and over many years. The fermentation, isolation, purification and detoxification steps for each serotype took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The monovalent bulks were completed in 1971, and first packaged in 1978. Investigational New Drug (IND) status was granted for the PBT under the CDC's IND 161 (at risk workers) and under the United States Army's Office of Surgeon General IND 3723 (for military deployment). The MDPH product was studied and used as an investigational vaccine from 1979 until the present time. An effort is ongoing on the part of the US Army to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for the PBT lots PBP003 and PBP004. For licensure of the PBT, FDA required that a pivotal clinical trial be performed to re-evaluate safety and assess immunogenicity of the toxoid,and that a new lot of toxoid be manufactured to demonstrate reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process and consistency of the manufactured product. The final report on the pivotal clinical study was expected in June 2000. This study will have evaluated, in a significant number of participants, the protective immunogenicity of all 5 serotype vaccines with respect to their homologous neurotoxins. Results from this pivotal study and the status of a new-generation, recombinant vaccine will be factors in deciding whether to proceed with a new lot of toxoid (Byrne et al., 2000).",Aluminum Hydroxide,alum,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0000127,aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum vaccine adjuvant that contains aluminum hydroxide.,alum,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,

68,VO:0001241,VO_0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,"Domain 4 contains the dominant protective epitopes of PA and comprises amino acids 596-735 of the carboxy terminus of the PA polypeptide. Cell intoxication is thought to occur when full-length PA (PA83) binds to the cell surface receptor via domain 4, which contains the host cell receptor binding site. After binding to the host cell receptor, the N-terminal amino acids (1-167, i.e. domain 1a) of domain 1, which contains a furin protease cleavage site, are cleaved off, exposing the LF or EF binding site located in domain 1b and the adjacent domain 3. Domains 2 and 3 then form part of a heptameric pore on the cell surface, the LF or EF binds to its receptor, and the whole toxin complex undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis into the cell. After acidification of the endosome, the toxin is translocates into the cell cytosol, where it exerts its cytotoxic effect. Therefore, inhibition of the binding and entry of the toxin complex, particularly lethal toxin, into the host cell is clearly important for the prevention of infection. The crystal structure of PA shows domain 4 to be more exposed than the other three domains, which are closely associated with each other. This structural arrangement may make the epitopes in domain 4 the most prominent for recognition by immune effector cells (Flick-Smith et al., 2002).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,
69,VO:0001241,VO_0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are a group of seven (Aâ€“G) antigenically distinct proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacillus found in soil and marine sediments from all parts of the world. BoNTs inhibit the release of acetylcholine (ACH) at the synapse of motor neurons, which initially causes muscle weakness, progressing to flaccid paralysis, subsequent ventilatory failure, and death. This can happen at very low concentrations of BoNT (10âˆ’9 g/kg), making the toxin one of the most potent poisons known.The most common exposures to BoNT are food-borne, infant, and wound botulism. The likely mode of delivery of BoNT in bio-warfare or terrorist scenarios is through aerosol delivery. Toxicity from BoNT can be lethal without early detection and intensive supportive therapy. Trivalent equine-based antitoxins (A, B, and E) are available and are used clinically to neutralize and clear BoNT from the circulatory system. A number of different products have been proposed as candidate vaccines against BoNT. For BoNT to express its deleterious effects, sequential mechanistic events are carried out by three discrete structural domains of the protein. The BoNT exert toxicity only after they bind specifically to a neuron receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This receptor-toxin complex is then internalized within a vesicle followed by translocation of a portion of the toxin into the neuronal cytosol. This part of the molecule is responsible for the inherent toxicity that arises from its endoprotease activity on neurovesicle transport proteins. Once enzymatically inactivated by the toxin, these ""SNARE"" proteins cannot facilitate ACH-containing neurovesicles docking to the plasma membrane at the neuromuscular junction. This inhibits the vesicle from expelling its contents (ACH) into the synaptic space. The different toxin events are brought about by distinct protein domains of the holotoxin that are nearly equal in mass, which have been structurally and functionally defined. The holotoxin, approximately 150 kDa, consists of a heavy chain (approximately 100 kDa) that extends from the carboxy terminus to a disulfide bridge where the light chain (approximately 50 kDa) is attached. The receptor-binding domain is found in the carboxy portion of the heavy chain known as the C fragment or HC region. The remaining fragment of the heavy chain is known as the HN and, with the carboxy terminus of the light chain, spans the disulfide bridge to comprise the translocation domain, which facilitates light-chain entry into the neuronal cytoplasm. The light chain contains the zinc-dependent endoprotease domain responsible for inactivating docking proteins, inhibiting exocytosis, and the inherent toxicity of BoNT. Because BoNT toxicity is neuro-specific and enzymatic, while substrate is limited, relatively few molecules of BoNT are necessary to inhibit neurovesicle docking and expulsion. A number of regions of the BoNT have been investigated and cloned for potential use as immunogens for recombinant vaccine candidates A and B serotypes. The C fragment of BoNT was a logical choice for a vaccine candidate based on its native function, immunogenicity, and lack of observed signs of toxicity (Boles et al., 2006).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,

Thus, a new vaccine for plague based on the protective protein sub-units capsular Fraction 1 (Caf1) and LcrV is under development. The Caf1 molecule is a temperature-regulated capsular protein of Y. pestis which is maximally expressed at 37 °C and which has a role in resistance of phagocytosis. The LcrV antigen of Y. pestis is a 37 kDa secreted protein that is known to have a role in modulation of host defence mechanisms by down-regulating production of IFN-γ and TNF-α and and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It is also believed to act as a virulence factor with a key role in the Type III secretion system of Y. pestis. Immunisation with recombinant LcrV antigen adsorbed to the adjuvant alhydrogel has been shown to confer protection against virulent challenge by both the sub-cutaneous and airborne routes. The use of the rCaf1 and rLcrV subunits in combination has been shown to have an additive effect on protection in murine models of infection and the two sub-units when formulated with alhydrogel are being taken forward into clinical trials as a vaccine for human use (Elvin et al., 2006)",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,

LcrV injection of animals triggered release of interleukin-10, a cytokine that suppresses innate immune functions. LcrV also prevents the release of proinflammatory cytokines (gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor ) in murine and human macrophages. Considering the immune modulatory properties of rLcrV, there are concerns regarding the safety of LcrV vaccines in humans. Thus, there is an emphasis upon searching for variants with reduced immune modulatory properties. rV10, a variant lacking amino acids 271 to 300 of LcrV, displayed a significant decrease in its ability to induce interleukin-10 and to suppress tumor necrosis factor or gamma interferon release (DeBord et al., 2006).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,
73,VO:0001241,VO_0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,"This vaccine utilizes a combination of the Fraction 1 antigen (F1) and the V antigen of Y. pestis in an optimum molar ratio. The F1 and V antigens, in recombinant form in this vaccine, are natural virulence factors of Y. pestis. Fraction 1 antigen, the major protein component of the capsule surrounding Y. pestis cells, is expressed only at 37 °C and it is believed to have anti-phagocytic activity. High anti-F1 titres have been correlated with survival following plague infection. Recombinant F1 antigen (rF1) has been produced by cloning the caf operon from Y. pestis into Escherichia coli and the protection provided by highly purified native F1 and recombinant F1 against Y. pestis has been demonstrated not to differ. The V antigen of Y. pestis is a secreted protein that is thought to act both as a regulatory protein and as a virulence factor. The V antigen has a key role in the Type III secretion process utilised by Y. pestis to translocate cytotoxic and anti-phagocytic Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into the host cell. Supporting evidence for this role has been gained and the V antigen has been visualised on the bacterial cell surface (Jones et al., 2003). Both the rF1 and rV proteins, administered in alhydrogel, have been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and protective against virulent plague in a number of animal models: mice, guinea pigs, and cynomolgus macaques (unpublished data). Further, the combination of rF1 plus rV is additive in the protection conferred on the vaccinee. In the mouse, the combined immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) titer to rF1 plus rV has been shown to correlate with protection against challenge. Further, protection against plague in the mouse has been demonstrated by the passive transfer of antiserum specific for rF1 plus rV from immunized BALB/c mice into naïve SCID/beige mice (Williamson et al., 2005).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,

These toxins exert their action by blocking release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. BoNT are usually expressed in as a single polypeptide chain and then post-translationally nicked, forming a dichain consisting of a 100-kDa heavy chain and a 50-kDa light chain held together by a single disulfide bond. Topologically, these neurotoxins are composed of three domains: binding, translocation, and catalytic, each of which is believed to play a role in intoxication. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain is responsible for binding nerve cell receptor(s). After toxin binding, it is thought to be internalized into an endosome through receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is believed that the 50-kDa amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain possesses channel-forming capabilities when in the acidic environment of the endosome, allowing internalization of the toxin. The final step in the mechanism involves zinc-dependent proteolysis by the catalytic domain of key cytosolic substrates necessary for neurotransmitter release (Byrne et al., 1998).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,
87,VO:0001241,VO_0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,"Anthrax involves a dual process of bacterial replication and toxin production. The dually active anthrax vaccine (DAAV) confers simultaneous protection against both bacilli and toxins was highly sought after through research. The weakly immunogenic and antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance in a similar manner to the role of capsular polysaccharides in protecting pathogens, such as pneumococci and meningococci. Encapsulated B. anthracis strains grow unimpeded in the infected host, whereas isolates lacking the capsule are phagocytized and are virtually avirulent. Anthrax toxins are formed by PA, lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF), which are secreted separately as nontoxic monomers. The binding of LF or EF to PA results in the formation of active lethal toxin (LT) or edema toxin (ET), respectively. Because of its ability to elicit a protective immune response against both anthrax toxins, PA is the target antigen of existing anthrax vaccine. However, a vaccine based on both PGA and PA might allow direct targeting of bacillar growth, as well as inhibiting toxin activity, making it more effective than a vaccine based on PA alone. PGA is an attractive antigen because it consists of d-glutamic acid residues linked by Î³ peptide bonds, and thus bears no resemblance to mammalian host molecules (Rhie et al., 2003).",Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,VO:0001241,Alhydrogel vaccine adjuvant,An aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvant that is a gel that is made by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 under alkaline conditions.,Alhydrogel,Th2-biased immune profile,,,,
