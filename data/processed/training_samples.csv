However, like LPS, MPL has been shown to be capable of binding and activating the so-called Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), present on key antigen-presenting cells, which play an important role in the induction of the innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Recent observations suggest that TLR4 agonist, such as MPL, directly affect adaptive immune responses via specific interactions with B cells.

Titermax adjuvant protect the antigen from rapid degradation (Allison, 1979; Osebold, 1982). This depot effect prolongs the exposure of antigens to the hostâ€™s immune system. The use of deposit agents, oils (paraffin oil for FCA and squalene for TM, respec- tively), facilitates enhanced macrophage phagocytosis. Immune stimulation and augmentation of antigen processing are achieved by killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in FCA, and the block copolymer in TM (Hunter et al., 1989).

We hypothesize that the co-administration of tumor antigens together with the strong pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 provides the environment with inflammatory danger signals required to activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) and prevents tolerance induction towards the tumor antigens. In addition, IL-12 directs the development of T-helper lymphocytes towards the type 1 (Th1) functional profile that promotes cellular immune responses and stimulates the proliferation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and thereby the establishment of immune memory [Ref1733:Portielje et al., 2003].","IL-12 has been used as an adjuvant to cancer vaccination attempts in two settings.

Cells require co-expression of both genes to secrete biologically active IL-12. IL-12 is primarily produced by phagocytic cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as monocytes, DC and activated B lymphocytes, and production is strongly stimulated by infectious pathogens and their products.

Nevertheless, aluminium salts do induce the production of IL-4, which plays a key role in humoral responses. However, like LPS, MPL has been shown to be capable of binding and activating the so-called Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), present on key antigen-presenting cells, which play an important role in the induction of the innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Recent observations suggest that TLR4 agonist, such as MPL, directly affect adaptive immune responses via specific interactions with B cells. Based on the current data demonstrating similar relative boost ability of total antibody responses with Alum and AS04 formulations it is very likely that VLPs complement the ability of MPL to enhance the humoral immune responses [Ref1748:Giannini et al., 2006].","MPL adjuvant is a chemically modified derivative of lipopolysaccharide that displays greatly reduced toxicity while maintaining most of the immunostimulatory activity of lipopolysaccharide.

The mechanisms of action of alum include: depot formation facilitating continuous antigen release; particulate structure formation promoting antigen phagocytosis by APC's such as DC, macrophages, and B cells; and increased MHC class II expression and antigen presentation [Ref1925:Dubensky and Reed, 2010].","Aluminum compounds are the only adjuvants used widely with routine human vaccines and are the most common adjuvants in veterinary vaccines. Though there has been a search for alternate adjuvants, aluminum adjuvants will continue to be used for many years due to their good track record of safety, low cost and adjuvanticity with a variety of antigens. These adjuvants are often referred to as alum [Ref1908:Gupta, 1998].","Aluminum compounds such as aluminum phosphate (AlPO4), and aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) [Ref1908:Gupta, 1998].",Licensed,,,,,,Aluminum vaccine adjuvant,Yellow Fever NS1 Protein Vaccine,Subunit vaccine,,59.0,VO_0004151,Yellow fever,Yellow fever virus,,,,Subunit vaccine

Moreover, [Munoz et al. [14] demonstrated that Thl clones were more susceptible to CT inhibition as compared to Th2 clones, suggesting that CT may affect subsets of T cells differently: despite the aforementioned, both the holotoxin and its B subunit (CTB) function as very strong immunogens in vivo, efficiently stimulating CT specific T cells [15-17][Ref1705:HÃ¶rnquist and Lycke, 1993].","Cholera toxin (CT) given perorally is a powerful mucosal immunogen and adjuvant.

In addition, it enhances expression of class II MHC and B7 costimulatory molecules, that leads to improved antigen presentation. Furthermore, CpG DNA also directly activates monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete various cytokines and chemokines that can provide T-helper functions. Immunization of animals against a variety of antigens delivered parenterally (e.g. IM or SC) demonstrate that addition of CpG ODN induces more T-helper type 1 (Th1)-like responses as indicated by strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), high levels of IgG2a antibodies, and predominantly Th1 cytokines (e.g. IL-12 and IFN-Î³ but not IL-4 or IL-5).

Both FCA and TM utilize the same type of emulsion (water-in-oil) and mode of antigen incorporation (encapsulation in oil with long retention), but they employ different immunomodulators, killed whole Mycobacterium and copolymer CRL89- 41, respectively. Titermax adjuvant protect the antigen from rapid degradation (Allison, 1979; Osebold, 1982). This depot effect prolongs the exposure of antigens to the hostâ€™s immune system. The use of deposit agents, oils (paraffin oil for FCA and squalene for TM, respec- tively), facilitates enhanced macrophage phagocytosis. Immune stimulation and augmentation of antigen processing are achieved by killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in FCA, and the block copolymer in TM (Hunter et al., 1989).

In addition, it enhances expression of class II MHC and B7 costimulatory molecules, that leads to improved antigen presentation. Furthermore, CpG DNA also directly activates monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete various cytokines and chemokines that can provide T-helper functions. Immunization of animals against a variety of antigens delivered parenterally (e.g. IM or SC) demonstrate that addition of CpG ODN induces more T-helper type 1 (Th1)-like responses as indicated by strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), high levels of IgG2a antibodies, and predominantly Th1 cytokines (e.g. IL-12 and IFN-Î³ but not IL-4 or IL-5).

Nevertheless, aluminium salts do induce the production of IL-4, which plays a key role in humoral responses. However, like LPS, MPL has been shown to be capable of binding and activating the so-called Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), present on key antigen-presenting cells, which play an important role in the induction of the innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Recent observations suggest that TLR4 agonist, such as MPL, directly affect adaptive immune responses via specific interactions with B cells. Based on the current data demonstrating similar relative boost ability of total antibody responses with Alum and AS04 formulations it is very likely that VLPs complement the ability of MPL to enhance the humoral immune responses [Ref1748:Giannini et al., 2006].","MPL adjuvant is a chemically modified derivative of lipopolysaccharide that displays greatly reduced toxicity while maintaining most of the immunostimulatory activity of lipopolysaccharide. MPL adjuvant has been used extensively in clinical trials as a component in prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines targeting infectious disease, cancer and allergies [Ref1747:Evans et al., 2003]. MPL is a potent stimulator of T cell and antibody responses. MPL is the first and only TLR ligand in licensed human vaccines, in the form of AS04. MPL is licensed in Europe for allergy treatment Pollinex Quattro.

It has been reported that CT increases gut permeability and uptake of luminal antigens, enhances Ag presentation and promotes B cell isotype-switch differentiation. In contrast, mostly inhibitory effects on T cells in vitro have been reported. Several studies have documented blocking effects of CT on T cell signal transduction and IL-2 production. Moreover, [Munoz et al. [14] demonstrated that Thl clones were more susceptible to CT inhibition as compared to Th2 clones, suggesting that CT may affect subsets of T cells differently: despite the aforementioned, both the holotoxin and its B subunit (CTB) function as very strong immunogens in vivo, efficiently stimulating CT specific T cells [15-17][Ref1705:HÃ¶rnquist and Lycke, 1993].","Cholera toxin (CT) given perorally is a powerful mucosal immunogen and adjuvant.

The water-soluble material has a stronger adjuvant activity than equal amounts of whole bacteria, cell walls, or waxes D, and seems to be the first well-defined, water-soluble, adjuvant-active fraction isolated from Mycobacteria [Ref1693:Adam et al., 1972].","IFA types of adjuvant products have been, and continue to be, used in veterinary vaccine products.
